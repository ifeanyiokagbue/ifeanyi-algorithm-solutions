# Ifeanyi's Algorithm Solutions

## Introduction
In this Repository, I will be solving one Algorithm at a time using C#. I will also break down below each of the algorithms I have solved in this project folder.

## Algorithm Solutions
This is the list of the algorithms I have already solved. I will keep updating it as I add new Algorithms. I have also linked each of the algorithm to the issue which 
would show the question and either the commit that shows the code or a link to the class that has the code snippet that solves the algorithm.
